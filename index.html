      <h2>2025-8-07Short story</h2>
      <p>These days, lots of people eat junk food for lunch like hamburgers or pizza. However, doctors say junk foods are not healthy and addictive. So should we eat junk foods? Because they have 
        lots of calories, so we can live with less amount of food. But, it is low in nutrients. It lacks essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber, which are important for overall health. Also, it is 
        high in fat, sugar, and sodium. These components contribute to the hyperpalatability of junk food, making it hard to resist and potentially leading to overeating. Even though it is highly 
        processed. Many junk foods undergo extensive processing, which can reduce their nutritional value and add unhealthy additives. So junk foods are so delicious but, because these are not health, 
        so we should eat carefully.

      <h2>2025-8-04Does internet medical information make people healthier?</h2>
      <p>These days, we can easily find information through the internet. Not like past, we can just search on internet instead go find expert, and library to find a book. So when people are sick 
        they just search the internet first instead of going to the doctor, but is it good? Because the internet is free for every one, anyone can write in there. So most information is mostly wrong 
        because they are not experts. Also, some people are writing wrong information for their profit. And the internet doesn't have every symptom case so it can't give a personal diagnosis. Even so, 
        the internet is still a good option, because it is free, easy, and quick. Also all problems can be solved. Trusted problems can be solved by using a proven site. They have a site that only 
        doctors can write, and is made by the government. If we use these, it is trusted. And personal treatment can be solved with AI. You can talk to AI about your symptoms, and AI can give you a 
        personal diagnosis. As technology develops, our life is getting easier. So I believe we can fully trust information in internet in future

      <h2>2025-8-02Are homework assignments beneficial for high school students? </h2>
      <p>In our school. Lots of students have homework, and they are tired of lots of homework. Sometimes, they couldn’t do their homework because they were too busy. 
        And that causes bad memories at school, and lots of students are hating school because of homework. So are homework assignments beneficial for high school students?
        First of all, homeworks is a great way to make students review what they learned at school. Through homework, they can relearn what they learned from school, and it helps to 
        remember what they learned longer. But, because they are high schoolers, they are busy doing their own work. They need to prepare colleagues, so they might need to volunteer, 
        own a project, and some other things. They are running out of time to do that. So what I think is, school should give homework that can finish in 2 hours. They can spend 2 hours 
        finishing homework, and what they need to do.

      <h2>2025-7-30Should single-use plastics be banned?</h2>
      <p>Today, we saw lots of plastic packages. These are used for food deliveries, gifts, and more. We are using these because they are cheap, easy to use and clean. But there are problems. 
        They abandon them into the ocean, forest, and even in cities. So they are polluting the world. So, Should we ban that? Yes, if we banned it, there will be no more pollution, and the earth 
        can get clean again. But, I think it is not possible to do it. There is no substitute for it. So people might not be able to buy something from the market, because they are all packaged in 
        plastic. I think before banning plastic, we should find a substitute for that. Like edible plastic, or plastic that can easily decompose.<p>

      <h2>2025-7-29Is social media benefical to students?</h2>
      <p>Today, we can see lots of people using their phones to use social media. And it is also happening in schools too. But, it causes problems. People are getting addicted to it, and use it to bully someone. 
        \Even so, there are lots of benefits there. First, it can connect people who are far away. So schools used social media to have class still at home. Also, it can be a fun and simple hobby and even takes very little money. 
        But it can be a problem, because we can use it everywhere, and it is fun even though it is simple, people get addicted to it. It also happens to students, and it is very bad for their learning environment. Social media can 
        be used to bully someone. Lots of perpetrators use social media to bully someone, like mock or cuss. And it is very easy to start, and difficult to find perpetrators, so it became a serious problem. So what should we do? I 
        think one solution is to let students use social media apps from school. I mean let schools make their own social media, and limits and watch over students.<p>

      <h2>2025-7-28Should we band cell phone from school?</h2>
      <p>Since technology developed and we can usualy see cellphones and other digital devices in our life. They can help our life easier like its can 
        make possible to communicate with someone everywhere. Yes, its are helpful to our life and it cahnged our life, but there are problems. Some people addicited to phone, 
      and they could not live normaly. Also it is happening in our schools. Through this lots of teachers and parents says we should ban cellphone form school. 
        Especally, in school they don't need cellphone. During the school times, students using phones to play games or texting to friends. It will not help to students leaning in school.
      Also phones can be used to bully someone. As phone being natural, some students started bullying someone in internet. So it will never help students in school, but without theses, phones
      can be useful tool. We can ask question in internet, so we can get answer form lots of people fastly and save money to hire more teachers. Also some students are using phone to 
      contant their parents to give information about school and ask to pick them home. So what should we do? Even phones can be great tool and great device, most students are using phone not great way
      ofcores not most of them are using phones to bullying, but they use it to play games or texting to friends during class. Through this I think we should ban cell phones from schools.<p>

      <h2>2025-7-26 Horizon retreat testimony</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Jimin. At first, it was my first Horizon. Before I go to Horizon, I repeat sins, and I don’t know what I should do. I committed sins, 
        and repent and committed sin again. I really hate my sins and I really wanted to end that repeats. So I had a question, how to not repeat sins, and what
        should I do?.  I solved all of the questions through the Horizon. I needed the Holy Spirit. The Holy spirit will give a new heart from sinned heart to new
        heart, and he will make us holy and guide the right way. And also I learned how to let the holy spirit dwell in me. I should truly repent and say, “I need 
        you”. I was so thankful to God that he made me know what I needed through Horizon, and I realized again that God loves me and cares about me. And also 
        during surman, living for flash is death, and we should live for spirit, I realized I was living for flesh. I did what I wanted and I only cared about me.
        I say I am christian, but my behavior was not. I realized all I need is Jesus and how I really need the holy spirit. So I repent all of my sins. God also
        made me realize how I need a holy spirit. So I am so thankful to God's love and mercy that he gave guidance to me. Thank you for hearing.</p>

      <h2>2025-7-19 Can failure be more valuable than success?</h2>
      <p>In our life, people are getting failure or success from their work or something. When we fail, it feels very sad. If we fail, it means we are not 
        able to do my plan, and act not like planned. Through this, lots of people feel failures shouldn't exist. But failures are not just bad things. We 
        could learn from our failures. Failure is another chance that starts with better knowledge. But some still think If we only had success, it could 
        be much better. It is wrong. In our life, everyone should fail. It can be the past, now or future. So if we don’t have failure in our life until now,
        we can’t overcome our failure. It will come in the future. I think we should have failed before we became adults, when we were kids, especially teena
        gers. Because we will have failed someday, so if we already had failure, and if we overcome it, we can easily overcome it. The important thing is we 
        should overcome, it means we should try to overcome. Just try everything, then we can overcome failure. Once we fail, we can do second, third and for
        th and more!. So being fail, and overcome.</p>

      <h2>2025-7-17<h2>
      <p>Today, I woke up in the morning, I had family worship. We read Luke chapter one.
        It was a story about the birth of John, the baptism and prophecy of Jesus. Afterwards, me and my sisters went to the library, because it opens at 10 am. We played 
        badminton before it got open. My sisters and I had lots of fun. After we entered the library, I started to solve math problems. I learned about function, 
        function graph, and some rules for calculating. Fortunately I could finish it at the library. So I am thankful to god. We came back home and ate dinner wi
        th our family. We ate fried noodles. It was so delicious. But, I could not write essays and memorize words. So tomorrow, I’ll only focus on my job</p>

      <h2>2025-7-16 Should everyone become vegetarian to save the planet?</h2>
      <p>People ate meat. It can destroy the earth. Why? Because while we raise livestock, they produce a lot of CO2. CO2 causes heating the earth. And there
        is much other evidence that if we raise livestock, it will pollute the earth. So should we become vegetarian to save the planet? For the earth, we sho
        uld become vegetarian. Because livestocks produce lots of pollution. They produce CO2 and it affects air. And to raise livestock, they burn the forest t
        o make fields for livestock farming, it also produces CO2. For the earth, and for our living place, we should stop eating meat. But the human body needs
        meat. We need protein, and meat includes lots of protein. We can’t find protein from vegetables. If we don’t eat protein, we lose muscles. And being unh
        ealthy. So we shouldn't be vegetarian but we need to reduce meat from our meal.</p>

      <h2>2025-7-15 Should we use AI at school?</h2>
      <p>These days, technologies are getting developed, now we have a wonderful, and powerful tool, AI. AI stands for Artificial Intelligence, 
        it means an intelligence that is made, not natural. At first, AI wasn’t influential, and didn't have enough skill to do people’s work.
        Also, it was not available to the general public. However, today, AIs are very clever, and it is available to the general public. Through this, 
        lots of students started to use AI in their school, and use it to help their tasks. So should we use AI at school? Because some students use AI to
        do their homework, and other work, it becomes a problem. We can use AI to help study, like asking questions, and getting grammar checks. The problem 
        is cheating and plagiarism. Students are using AI to cheat in tests, and do their homework. It makes them not learn. This is why lots of schools banned AI
        from their schools. But AI is still a good tool to learn. It saves money and time. So I think we should use AI at school, but only for helping study.</p>

      <h2>2025-7-14</h2>
      <p>Today, July 14th, I led the family warship morning. It was Mark 14. Because I prepared yesterday, I could share the meaning of verses. 
        While I read that Peter realized, he denied Jesus three times like Jesus says, I felt I wanted to be like Peter so don't be insensitive to sin. 
        I was insensitive to sins, so I lied a lot, but I didn’t repent. After worship, I wrote my thoughts about Mark 14 verse 38 “Watch and pray that you will 
        not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the fresh is weak. Through this, I realized, I need to watch and pray. I always fall into temptation. 
        Even though I have work to do, I fall into the temptation to be comfortable so I was being lazy, and after I didn’t tell the truth, I lied to pass that
        situation. So I actually thought I really needed to pray to god very desperately. And I went to the library to study. I did not do a good job because I
        didn’t finish what I planned. I planned to finish my math at the library, but I couldn't because I learned new things, not like the past, that just solve
        problems that I know. I learned about special factorization and complex numbers. It was not simple, and abstract. So I really felt I needed to study more. 
        After I came back home, fortunately I finished my math, but I’m still working overtime. So tomorrow, I think I should focus more than today. At last one t
        hankful thing is even I worked overtimes, It’s looks like I can finish in time.</p>

      <h2>면담록 2024-7-16</h2>
      <p>1. 음악 - 나는 피아노를 연주할 때 처음에는 안 되지만 연습함으로써 곡을 완성하는 과정에서 기쁨을 느낀다. 그게 내가 피아노를 계속 하고 싶은 이유이다.
        하지만 오랫동안 연습하지 않았더니 잊어간다. 그래서 피아노 연습이 필요하다. (피아노를 사게 되면)<br><br>
        2. 운동 - 미국에서는 농구를 많이 한다고 들었다. 그래서 나는 학교에서 친구를 사귀기 위해 농구를 연습할 것이다.
        드리블 기술과 슛 기술을 연습할 것이다. (새누리 교회 농구코트)<br><br>
        3. 공부 - 일단 영어가 되어야 하므로 로컬 교회에서 사람들에게 말을 걸어볼 것이다. 그렇게 자꾸 대화하다 보면 어느 정도 될 것이다.
        다른 과목은 책을 부쳤으므로 도착하면 읽으며 공부할 것이다.</p>

      <h2>2025 Maxico Mission Testimony</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Jimin. I went on this Mexico mission. At first, this was my first missionary. It was tiring and difficult, but it was a good experience for me. 
        One blessing from the last day of the VBS skit was about Peter denying Jesus and Jesus forgiving him. Church A couldn't practice last night because we didn't have enough time.
        So we were really about to cut the skit part. But our team doesn't want to cut the skit part, so we practice while going to church. It was only 40 minutes, and we couldn't hear the audio,
        which was playing our skit lines. After arriving at church, we prayed to help us perform skits in front of kids and to help the kids learn about Jesus’ love through our skit. After praying,
        we did one more practice and showed it to Jessie, who is the skit team leader, and she accepted it. So we could show our skits to kids. And on the third day, we had prayer times. After going to pray, 
        pastor Paul gave some examples of devils coming to us. It was arguing with someone, and the example was arguing over a job, so it's like saying it’s my job, and no, it's my job. At that time, 
        because we’re here to share the gospel, not only for volunteering. We need to cooperate, not argue. And also, we can do God's work when we love others and become one. But at that time, I remembered I did the same thing. 
        When I was in church, I was handing out name tags. Another boy started doing it, so I said to him, It's my job, which is the same as what pastor Paul says. Through this, I could know I had sinned, and I could pray to repent. 
        I am thankful to god. Thank you.</p>
