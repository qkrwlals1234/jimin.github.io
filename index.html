      <h2>2025-7-17<h2>
      <p>Today, I woke up in the morning, I had family worship. We read Luke chapter one.
It was a story about the birth of John, the baptism and prophecy of Jesus. Afterwards, me and my sisters went to the library, because it opens at 10 am. We played 
        badminton before it got open. My sisters and I had lots of fun. After we entered the library, I started to solve math problems. I learned about function, 
        function graph, and some rules for calculating. Fortunately I could finish it at the library. So I am thankful to god. We came back home and ate dinner wi
        th our family. We ate fried noodles. It was so delicious. But, I could not write essays and memorize words. So tomorrow, I’ll only focus on my job

      <h2>2025-7-16 Should everyone become vegetarian to save the planet?
</h2>
      <p>People ate meat. It can destroy the earth. Why? Because while we raise livestock, they produce a lot of CO2. CO2 causes heating the earth. And there
        is much other evidence that if we raise livestock, it will pollute the earth. So should we become vegetarian to save the planet? For the earth, we sho
        uld become vegetarian. Because livestocks produce lots of pollution. They produce CO2 and it affects air. And to raise livestock, they burn the forest t
        o make fields for livestock farming, it also produces CO2. For the earth, and for our living place, we should stop eating meat. But the human body needs
        meat. We need protein, and meat includes lots of protein. We can’t find protein from vegetables. If we don’t eat protein, we lose muscles. And being unh
        ealthy. So we shouldn't be vegetarian but we need to reduce meat from our meal.

      <h2>2025-7-15 Should we use AI at school?</h2>
      <p>These days, technologies are getting developed, now we have a wonderful, and powerful tool, AI. AI stands for Artificial Intelligence, 
        it means an intelligence that is made, not natural. At first, AI wasn’t influential, and didn't have enough skill to do people’s work.
        Also, it was not available to the general public. However, today, AIs are very clever, and it is available to the general public. Through this, 
        lots of students started to use AI in their school, and use it to help their tasks. So should we use AI at school? Because some students use AI to
        do their homework, and other work, it becomes a problem. We can use AI to help study, like asking questions, and getting grammar checks. The problem 
        is cheating and plagiarism. Students are using AI to cheat in tests, and do their homework. It makes them not learn. This is why lots of schools banned AI
        from their schools. But AI is still a good tool to learn. It saves money and time. So I think we should use AI at school, but only for helping study.</p>

      <h2>2025-7-14</h2>
      <p>Today, July 14th, I led the family warship morning. It was Mark 14. Because I prepared yesterday, I could share the meaning of verses. 
        While I read that Peter realized, he denied Jesus three times like Jesus says, I felt I wanted to be like Peter so don't be insensitive to sin. 
        I was insensitive to sins, so I lied a lot, but I didn’t repent. After worship, I wrote my thoughts about Mark 14 verse 38 “Watch and pray that you will 
        not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the fresh is weak. Through this, I realized, I need to watch and pray. I always fall into temptation. 
        Even though I have work to do, I fall into the temptation to be comfortable so I was being lazy, and after I didn’t tell the truth, I lied to pass that
        situation. So I actually thought I really needed to pray to god very desperately. And I went to the library to study. I did not do a good job because I
        didn’t finish what I planned. I planned to finish my math at the library, but I couldn't because I learned new things, not like the past, that just solve
        problems that I know. I learned about special factorization and complex numbers. It was not simple, and abstract. So I really felt I needed to study more. 
        After I came back home, fortunately I finished my math, but I’m still working overtime. So tomorrow, I think I should focus more than today. At last one t
        hankful thing is even I worked overtimes, It’s looks like I can finish in time.</p>

      <h2>면담록 2024-7-16</h2>
      <p>1. 음악 - 나는 피아노를 연주할 때 처음에는 안 되지만 연습함으로써 곡을 완성하는 과정에서 기쁨을 느낀다. 그게 내가 피아노를 계속 하고 싶은 이유이다.
        하지만 오랫동안 연습하지 않았더니 잊어간다. 그래서 피아노 연습이 필요하다. (피아노를 사게 되면)<br><br>
        2. 운동 - 미국에서는 농구를 많이 한다고 들었다. 그래서 나는 학교에서 친구를 사귀기 위해 농구를 연습할 것이다.
        드리블 기술과 슛 기술을 연습할 것이다. (새누리 교회 농구코트)<br><br>
        3. 공부 - 일단 영어가 되어야 하므로 로컬 교회에서 사람들에게 말을 걸어볼 것이다. 그렇게 자꾸 대화하다 보면 어느 정도 될 것이다.
        다른 과목은 책을 부쳤으므로 도착하면 읽으며 공부할 것이다.</p>

      <h2>2025 Maxico Mission Testimony</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Jimin. I went on this Mexico mission. At first, this was my first missionary. It was tiring and difficult, but it was a good experience for me. 
        One blessing from the last day of the VBS skit was about Peter denying Jesus and Jesus forgiving him. Church A couldn't practice last night because we didn't have enough time.
        So we were really about to cut the skit part. But our team doesn't want to cut the skit part, so we practice while going to church. It was only 40 minutes, and we couldn't hear the audio,
        which was playing our skit lines. After arriving at church, we prayed to help us perform skits in front of kids and to help the kids learn about Jesus’ love through our skit. After praying,
        we did one more practice and showed it to Jessie, who is the skit team leader, and she accepted it. So we could show our skits to kids. And on the third day, we had prayer times. After going to pray, 
        pastor Paul gave some examples of devils coming to us. It was arguing with someone, and the example was arguing over a job, so it's like saying it’s my job, and no, it's my job. At that time, 
        because we’re here to share the gospel, not only for volunteering. We need to cooperate, not argue. And also, we can do God's work when we love others and become one. But at that time, I remembered I did the same thing. 
        When I was in church, I was handing out name tags. Another boy started doing it, so I said to him, It's my job, which is the same as what pastor Paul says. Through this, I could know I had sinned, and I could pray to repent. 
        I am thankful to god. Thank you.</p>
