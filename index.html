      <h2>면담록 2024-7-16</h2>
      <p>1. 음악 - 나는 피아노를 연주할 때 처음에는 안 되지만 연습함으로써 곡을 완성하는 과정에서 기쁨을 느낀다. 그게 내가 피아노를 계속 하고 싶은 이유이다.
        하지만 오랫동안 연습하지 않았더니 잊어간다. 그래서 피아노 연습이 필요하다. (피아노를 사게 되면)<br><br>
        2. 운동 - 미국에서는 농구를 많이 한다고 들었다. 그래서 나는 학교에서 친구를 사귀기 위해 농구를 연습할 것이다.
        드리블 기술과 슛 기술을 연습할 것이다. (새누리 교회 농구코트)<br><br>
        3. 공부 - 일단 영어가 되어야 하므로 로컬 교회에서 사람들에게 말을 걸어볼 것이다. 그렇게 자꾸 대화하다 보면 어느 정도 될 것이다.
        다른 과목은 책을 부쳤으므로 도착하면 읽으며 공부할 것이다.</p>

      <h2>2025 Maxico Mission Testimony</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Jimin. I went on this Mexico mission. At first, this was my first missionary. It was tiring and difficult, but it was a good experience for me. 
        One blessing from the last day of the VBS skit was about Peter denying Jesus and Jesus forgiving him. Church A couldn't practice last night because we didn't have enough time.
        So we were really about to cut the skit part. But our team doesn't want to cut the skit part, so we practice while going to church. It was only 40 minutes, and we couldn't hear the audio,
        which was playing our skit lines. After arriving at church, we prayed to help us perform skits in front of kids and to help the kids learn about Jesus’ love through our skit. After praying,
        we did one more practice and showed it to Jessie, who is the skit team leader, and she accepted it. So we could show our skits to kids. And on the third day, we had prayer times. After going to pray, 
        pastor Paul gave some examples of devils coming to us. It was arguing with someone, and the example was arguing over a job, so it's like saying it’s my job, and no, it's my job. At that time, 
        because we’re here to share the gospel, not only for volunteering. We need to cooperate, not argue. And also, we can do God's work when we love others and become one. But at that time, I remembered I did the same thing. 
        When I was in church, I was handing out name tags. Another boy started doing it, so I said to him, It's my job, which is the same as what pastor Paul says. Through this, I could know I had sinned, and I could pray to repent. 
        I am thankful to god. Thank you.</p>
